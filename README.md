# reactPortfolio
## Description
This is a personal portfolio created using React. It utilizes a header and footer that stay throughout the whole operation of the webpage while adding content to the body based on the corresponding nav option the user selects. Various forms of contact are shown at the footer as well as a contact form that validates if the correct formatting for a contact email is used. 6 deployed projects are also shown with screenshots and links in the portfolio portion as well.

Although It could used some styling and TLC in the future this app taught me how to create and host apps using react.
